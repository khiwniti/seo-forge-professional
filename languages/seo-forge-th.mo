This is a binary file that would be generated from the .po file using msgfmt. Since I cannot generate binary files, you would need to use a tool like Poedit or the gettext msgfmt command to compile the .po file into a .mo file.

Command to generate .mo file:
msgfmt -o seo-forge-th.mo seo-forge-th.po
