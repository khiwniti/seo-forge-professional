# SEO Forge Professional - Duplicate Plugin Fix

## Issue Identified
The plugin was creating **two separate entries** in WordPress admin because both `seo-forge.php` and `seo-forge-complete.php` had WordPress plugin headers.

## Root Cause
- `seo-forge.php` had plugin headers (creating "SEO-Forge Professional")
- `seo-forge-complete.php` had plugin headers (creating "SEO-Forge Professional Complete")
- WordPress detected both as separate plugins

## Solution Applied
1. **Removed plugin headers** from `seo-forge.php` (now just a loader file)
2. **Updated `seo-forge-complete.php`** to be the main plugin file
3. **Changed plugin name** from "SEO-Forge Professional Complete" to "SEO-Forge Professional"
4. **Updated version** to 2.0.1 to reflect the fix

## What You Need to Do
1. **Delete both existing plugins** from WordPress admin
2. **Upload the new fixed version** (`seo-forge-professional-final-fixed.zip`)
3. **Activate the plugin** - you should now see only **ONE** plugin entry

## Files Changed
- `seo-forge.php` - Removed plugin headers, now just loads the main plugin
- `seo-forge-complete.php` - Updated to be the main plugin file

## Result
- Only **one plugin entry** will appear in WordPress admin
- No more duplicate plugin conflicts
- All display issues should be resolved

## Download
- **Fixed Plugin**: `seo-forge-professional-final-fixed.zip`
- **Repository**: https://github.com/khiwniti/seo-forge-professional
- **Version**: 2.0.1

The plugin is now properly structured with a single entry point and should work correctly without any duplicate plugin issues.
